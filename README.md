# HidDriver 360
Experimental on-console HID driver focussing on providing third party controller support to the xbox 360 without USB patches or dongles.

## What works
- Supports both 17559 retail and 17489 devkit dashboards
- Reading controller input via USB
- Up to 4 concurrent controllers, in combination with original xbox 360 controllers or without them
- Controllers are registered inside xam and therefore fully recognized in the entire xbox 360 user interface, ring of light will update accordingly, no original controllers are needed etc
- The controllers will work in all games that use XamInputGetState

## Current limitations
- Controllers currently need to be connected after the driver was loaded, so you may need to reconnect your controllers after a reboot if the console initialised them already
- Currently the controllers will only work in games and homebrew that use XamInputGetState to get the input data
- no rumble support

## Supported controllers
- Dualsense (PS5 controller)
- DualShock 4 (PS4 controller)
- more to come, as its quite easy to extend

## How to build
1. Acquire the official Xbox 360 SDK using black magic
2. Install visual studio 2010 ultimate and visual studio 2019
3. Install the sdk using the "FULL" preset
4. Open the solution in visual studio 2019 and build
5. Hopefully enjoy :)
